<p style="font-size: 25px;">Want to learn more about the world of bees? This website is for you! </p>

<p class="paragraph">Bees are the best insects in the world and it's not even
close. They work in a cohesive unit to build amazing structures and
polinate plants around the globe. Without this polination, those same
plants would in all likelihood go extinct. Furthermore, the animals
that eat those plants would struggle to find food and die off, causing
the carnivores (meat-eating animals) that rely on those plant-eating
animals as food would also struggle to eat. This doesn't just affect
the animals though - we'd suffer too. The Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) states that there are 100
crop species that provide 90% of food around the world and 71 of these
are pollinated by bees. Luckily for us, there are about 20,000 (28 native
and 13 introduced species in NZ) speciesof bees which can be found on all
continents except Antarctica. Aslong as we play our part in supporting our
little winged helpers,they'll help us back and put food on everyone's plate.</p>
